title: Miami University Basketball Lineup Optimization
---

# Executive Summary

This project provides strategic insight into optimal player lineup configurations for the Miami University Men’s Basketball team using player archetype analysis. By clustering MAC player statistics from the 2014–15 season onward, five archetypes were identified: Bench 3&D Guard, Interior Role Big, Versatile Scoring Forward, Off-Ball Shooting Guard, and Two-Way Lead Guard. These archetypes were used to assess historical lineup trends and their relationships with team performance. The results highlight patterns in archetype usage and suggest targeted strategies for both recruiting and lineup optimization. 

A general trend of an increasing number of Off-Ball Shooting Guards and a reduction in Interior Role Bigs was found, something quite consistent with the evolving trend surrounding the popularity of the three point shot. Analyzing key team statistics for the top three regular season teams from the MAC during that period also turned out to be fruitful. Teams with the highest winning percentages tend to have the most Off-Ball Shooting Guards in general and the least Interior Role Bigs. Furthermore, the higher the winning percentage of a team, the more Two-Way Lead Guards those teams tend to have. For offensive rating, it was uncovered that there is a sharp decline in the number of Bench 3&D Guards for the teams with the highest offensive ratings. Finally, the teams with the best defensive ratings seem to have significantly more Off-Ball Shooting Guards than those with lower defensive ratings. 

Looking into how the Miami University Men’s Basketball Team since Coach Travis Steele took over in the 2022-23 season, we observed that a sharp decline in the number of Off-Ball Shooting Guards and a sharp incline in the number of Two-Way Lead Guards rostered over the course of the last season has coincided with the massive improvement in the program’s winning percentage over the last season.
