## Executive Summary

  This project provides strategic insight into optimal player lineup configurations for the Miami University Men’s Basketball team using player archetype analysis. By clustering MAC player statistics from the 2014–15 season onward, five archetypes were identified: Bench 3&D Guard, Interior Role Big, Versatile Scoring Forward, Off-Ball Shooting Guard, and Two-Way Lead Guard. These archetypes were used to assess historical lineup trends and their relationships with team performance. The results highlight patterns in archetype usage and suggest targeted strategies for both recruiting and lineup optimization. 

  A general trend of an increasing number of Off-Ball Shooting Guards and a reduction in Interior Role Bigs was found, something quite consistent with the evolving trend surrounding the popularity of the three point shot. Analyzing key team statistics for the top three regular season teams from the MAC during that period also turned out to be fruitful. Teams with the highest winning percentages tend to have the most Off-Ball Shooting Guards in general and the least Interior Role Bigs. Furthermore, the higher the winning percentage of a team, the more Two-Way Lead Guards those teams tend to have. For offensive rating, it was uncovered that there is a sharp decline in the number of Bench 3&D Guards for the teams with the highest offensive ratings. Finally, the teams with the best defensive ratings seem to have significantly more Off-Ball Shooting Guards than those with lower defensive ratings. 

  Looking into how the Miami University Men’s Basketball Team since Coach Travis Steele took over in the 2022-23 season, we observed that a sharp decline in the number of Off-Ball Shooting Guards and a sharp incline in the number of Two-Way Lead Guards rostered over the course of the last season has coincided with the massive improvement in the program’s winning percentage over the last season.

## Introduction

  The purpose of this project is to provide meaningful insights about the most optimal lineup configurations by player ‘archetype’ to the Miami University Men’s Basketball team coaching staff so that they can make more informed recruiting decisions, both for high school recruits and potential targets in the transfer portal. The research is also looking to figure out ways to allow for a better understanding of how to improve game strategy moving forward. In an era of basketball increasingly shaped by three-point shooting, positionless play, and advanced analytics, understanding the makeup of effective lineups has never been more important. Yet, coaches often rely on traditional positional labels rather than data-driven archetypes that better reflect how players actually contribute on the court. Through the use of a cluster analysis of historical and current data pertaining to regular season individual player statistics for MAC players dating back to the 2014-15 season, identifiable player archetypes were identified that each player during this period fit into. Those player archetypes identified in the analysis were then named based on mean statistics for each cluster. These archetypes are Bench 3&D Guard, Interior Role Big, Versatile Scoring Forward, Off-Ball Shooting Guard, and Two-Way Lead Guard. Further analysis on how the Miami University Men’s Basketball team was then performed in order to determine the tendencies of the coaching staff when it comes to lineup strategies and the quality of those decisions based on their regular season success over a certain period of time.

  This research will also go into an in-depth analysis of how other MAC teams structure their lineups and how each team excels based on the distribution and utilization of different player archetypes. By comparing Miami Men’s Basketball to other schools in the MAC, the study aims to identify the best lineup construction for each opponent and situation. Each player archetype will be selected based on statistical metrics, physical characteristics, and play style. These metrics include offensive and defensive efficiency, usage, shooting statistics, and win percentage. For example, a Versatile Scoring Forward will likely play the majority of the game on both ends of the floor in comparison to a Bench 3&D Guard who has limited minutes to make an impact. In addition, this study will use visualizations and statistical models to map out lineup configurations and illustrate the best archetype fit. The data will be used to examine which archetypes are most successful with certain teammates in various situations. The goal of our study is to present our findings to Miami Men's Head Basketball Coach Travis Steele and his staff, with the aim of helping the team evaluate lineup performance from the past season and develop more informed strategies for future success.

  Ultimately, the integration of performance data into today’s sports landscape has opened the door for basketball leadership to view the game through a different lens. By shifting focus to player archetypes over typical positions, decision makers can find the best lineup fit for success. Whether influencing recruitment strategies or optimizing game strategy, our data-driven approach hopes to provide the Miami coaching staff with clear insights on the most effective practices.

## Methods

#### Shot Type Analysis
  Firstly, an initial exploratory analysis was conducted into the overall shot distribution of the MAC conference over the past decade. By doing so, it would give some insight into the overall playstyle of the MAC, something that will likely influence the archetypes of players the teams are pursuing. This would also provide a snapshot into whether the MAC should be the only conference analyzed, or whether play style is consistent enough throughout the whole of college basketball, where it may be more robust to do a full scale analysis. To do so, player data was gathered that was differentiated based on the type of shots being attempted. The categories of shot type are as follows: three-point, mid-range (from seventeen feet until the three point line), short range (less than seventeen feet but outside the restricted area), and at the rim. This data came from access to the Synergy database, from which each separate season was downloaded for each different shot type, aggregated together for all ten seasons, and separated by shot type. Then the MAC only teams were separated out and compared with the summary statistics of the various shot types to the entire NCAA over the same period of time. The data was divided to a specific team level to examine if there were any correlations between certain teams favoring a specific shot type over another and that team’s winning percentage. To see these relationships, graphs of each team’s shot tendencies over the ten-season period were created and compared to the MAC average. There were also a number of different linear regression models run to see if shot distribution had a statistically significant impact on the variance of a team’s winning percentage. 

#### Cluster Analysis
  Compiling our research for this project was a multi-step process that began with analyzing historical and current MAC basketball data that we obtained from the database, Synergy. Utilizing our unique access to NCAA men’s basketball data, we pulled a variety of offensive and defensive metrics that we determined to be important in player evaluation. The dataset spans back 10 years, containing individual player statistics for every season except for 2020-2021, which was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the teams did end up playing most of their games, there were many cases during that season where key players or sometimes entire teams would have to sit out for a large period of time due to someone contracting the disease, which would have impacted the data both in terms of the summary and in terms of any time-series analysis that may be performed. The data was also limited to only regular season games, as not every team plays the same number of conference tournament or national tournament games in addition to their regular season. There were a few statistics, primarily defensively focused, that would be useful for the clustering analysis that were not included in the Synergy database. To solve this issue, data from Sports Reference College Basketball (SRCBB) was also introduced.
  
  Next, we cleaned the data, removing any unnecessary metrics, fixed missing values, and filtered certain variables. When looking at player data, it was decided to filter out any players who averaged less than 10 minutes per game or appeared in less than 10 games, as these players act as noise that would likely not provide meaningful insights for the analysis. This record reduction decision resulted in a drop in total records used in the analysis from just over 1400 to just over 1000, which was still an acceptable number of records for this analysis. In merging the Synergy dataset with the Sports Reference College Basketball dataset, there were a lot of issues with the naming conventions for players and teams. Some naming conventions were simple to fix, where suffixes like ‘jr.’ or ‘III’ needed to be accounted for, but some required manual intervention, where all the non-matching names in the set that were left after our filtering were found manually and made to match properly. The final step taken before clustering was to normalize some of the continuous numeric statistics, as was performed by Diambra in his report, which was done for PTS, TRB, AST, Tov, STL, and BLK.

  Following data cleaning/wrangling, a cluster analysis was performed with the aim of grouping individuals based on play style. The k-means cluster analysis used FG%, 3P%, FT%, PtsPerMin, TRBPerMin, ASTPerMin, TovPerMin, STLPerMin, BLKPerMin, and Opp FG% within the model. To select the optimal number of clusters for our study, we used several different methods to try to determine the optimal number of clusters that would result in the best cluster analysis that balanced the need to have the least overlap with the need to have the most individuality. The results of the Elbow Method, which identifies the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly decreases the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares, were inconclusive, as arguments could be made for selecting 3, 5, or 8 clusters.

Looking at this figure, one can observe that there are slight elbows at those points, but there are no clear-cut points where one is better than the other, which resulted in all three points being considered as potential optimal numbers of clusters. Next,  the Silhouette Method measures how well a data point fits within its cluster compared to other clusters, measuring whether the player is an excellent example of its own cluster or just a bad example of the nearest neighboring cluster. A higher Silhouette score indicates that there is better clustering. After running this test, the optimal number of clusters the model came up with, as shown in Figure #, was 2, though given the context of the research, 2 clusters was not practical, as there need to be at least five players on the floor at one time and it does not make sense for a team to consist of six primary ball handlers and three post-up bigs. Lastly, the Gap Statistic was used, which compares how much the data within each cluster varies for different numbers of clusters and looks at how tightly packed the real clusters are compared to clusters created from randomly distributed data. As shown in Figure #, this method found that five would be the optimal number of clusters, as that is the beginning of the peak in the gap statistic. Considering the output of all three methods, five clusters was decided as the optimal number of clusters to be used in this analysis, as that figure was agreed upon by both the Elbow Method and Gap Statistic, and is still has a generally high silhouette score relative to other cluster numbers. Although this figure may slightly underestimate the total number of roles typically found on a team, it captures a full lineup and provides a sufficiently realistic framework for the purposes of this analysis.

  Once this was in place, the model was run and the results interpreted. Each cluster was assigned an archetype based on trends that we identified in the data, which was then used to identify players that fit each archetype, both from Miami University and the MAC as a whole. This step helped us go from an observational study to conclusions that can help coaches and team leadership with who to keep on the roster for next season and players to target in the transfer portal.
